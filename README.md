# Fullscreen Landing Page

This is a simple, responsive landing page that has a fullscreen background image for the header.  It was built with HTML and CSS, with some Flexbox styling.  It was adapted from a Traversy Media YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/hVdTQWASliE).  Credit for the background image goes to [Leon Schlüß](https://unsplash.com/photos/m-qZ3y9PQHM).
